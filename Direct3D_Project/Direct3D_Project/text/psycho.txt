Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. This might involve hallucinations or delusions. The two main symptoms of psychosis are:hallucinations  where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren't there; a common hallucination is hearing voices delusions  where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue  for example, thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour.Experiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode.
